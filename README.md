A collection of mods made by me for Balatro.
# 5 legendary challenges: Adds 5 challenges, each featuring a legendary joker.
- Destroyer: With eternal caino, pareidolia and sixth sense, you need to acquire and destroy 6s to get multi.
- Gotta Go Fast: Begin with triboulet, but the required score scales extremely fast.
- Bankrupt: Begin with $100 and yorick, but each discard costs $10, so eventually you'll go bankrupt.
- Anti-Medusa: The deck is full of stones, and the only way to unpetrify cards is the empress generated by perkeo.

# Betmma Voucher Pack: Adds a Booster Pack called Voucher Pack, allowing you to redeem 1 of 3 vouchers
This mod's code is based on [Coupon Book mod](https://github.com/nicholassam6425/balatro-mods/blob/main/balamod/mods/p_coupon_book.lua) which is for Balamod, and I ported it into steamodded.

# Better Vouchers This Run UI
Rewrite the Run Info - Vouchers tab to enable it to display dozens of redeemed vouchers.

# Note that [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded) is required to load the mods.
The mods are written and tested on Steamodded 0.9.8.
